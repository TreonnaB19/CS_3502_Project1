# Multi-Threading and Inter-Process Communication in C

## Overview
This project explores multi-threading and inter-process communication (IPC) in C. It consists of two main components:

1. **Multi-Threading (Project A)** – Utilizes the `pthread` library to create and manage multiple threads, implementing mutexes to ensure resource protection and prevent race conditions.
2. **Inter-Process Communication (Project B)** – Implements IPC using pipes to facilitate data exchange between parent and child processes.

The project was completed using VS Code with a WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) environment instead of a virtual machine. Compilation and execution were performed within the terminal. The C/C++ extension by Microsoft was used in VS Code for better code editing and debugging support
